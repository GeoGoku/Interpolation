Notes:
"scattered data -land survey-Yili.txt" is provided to generate the figure 10 and 11
“gridded data-1000-land survey-YIli.txt” presents the gridded data with a 1000 m grid interval. this is treated as a benchmark
“gridded data-500-land survey-YIli.txt” presents the gridded data with a 500 m grid interval. this is treated as a benchmark
“gridded data-200-land survey-YIli.txt” presents the gridded data with a 200 m grid interval. this is treated as a benchmark
